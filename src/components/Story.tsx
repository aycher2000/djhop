            <strong>"Farts, Burps, and $500 Later..."</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early 2000s, when real DJs were still pressing wax, <strong>DJ H.O.P</strong> and his crew
            found themselves in a peculiar situation. They had just wrapped up a record, but there was one problemâ€”some dead air at the end.
            So, in a moment of pure artistic <em>brilliance</em> (or absolute stupidity, depending on who you ask),
            they decided to fill it with <strong>nothing but farts and burps</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            They laughed, they mixed it down, and before they knew it, the record was sent off for
            <strong>vinyl mastering</strong>. Now, if you don't know, mastering for vinyl is a sacred art formâ€”only a handful of engineers
            in the world can do it right. One of those legends? <strong>George Horn.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This man had platinum plaques from <strong>Green Day, Tower of Power, even Prince.</strong> He had mastered
            some of the most iconic albums of all time. And nowâ€¦ he was mastering <strong>a fart symphony.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            George sat there in his legendary Bay Area studio, meticulously scanning for clipping and mixdown errors, when the moment arrived.
            The track played. A <em>beautifully mixed, stereo-enhanced, high-fidelity sequence of farts and burps.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>George Horn slowly turned to them.</strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <em>"What the actual f*** is this?"</em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            A lifetime of working with <strong>actual musicians</strong> had not prepared him for this moment.
            He was <strong>disgusted</strong>. Offended, even. If he had the power to revoke their DJ licenses,
            he probably would have.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thingâ€”<strong>they paid him $500.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            So George, the consummate professional, shook his head, sighed deeply, and finished the job. Somewhere out there,
            in the dusty crates of underground DJs, is a vinyl recordâ€”mixed, mastered, and pressedâ€”containing the most
            <em>high-quality fart noises</em> ever recorded.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what happens when you <strong>give turntablists too much time in the studio.</strong>
